# Hi, My name is VladüòÅ
My first exposure to IT was when I couldn't run CSGO on my computer in 6th grade. I tried to free up some memory, fix the HDD grinding noise by replacing its arm above the disk, change system files, accelerate the network, etc. The moment I solved the problem by upgrading the computer's specs, I realized that I fell in love with the process. As a result, I realized my key strengths: resourcefulness, adaptability, and versatility.

1. I am resourceful even from the moment I start only thinking about the work I have to do. For example, when I had started working on the website for Luxiglasses, I thought of every little detail in advance, considered all the pros and cons of every solution, and avoided using expensive third-party plug-ins which would cost a lot more than just developing some features on my own. Given that, I provided a great service, and the web app is functioning perfectly.

2. I am versatile in every task that I start. For example, when I had to set up the website on DigitalOcean, and it could not send emails, I started troubleshooting. The moment I realized that my code is perfect and had no problems, I started checking the Network side. Using the networking skills I learned in my CompTIA A+ cert and IT Network Technician job, I managed to figure out the issue in the firewall that blocked the necessary port. And I did not stop there, I also blocked unnecessary ports and added IP Filtering for bots that scan websites for config files.

3. At every job I had to learn something new and adapt. I was not afraid to ask questions. This was basically my whole life experience. When I came from Ukraine to USA, I had to start over. As of now, I went from being an immigrant with zero communication skills to being able to speak fluently and having worked 3 jobs related to IT, started studying in the college with GPA 4.0, and even started my own Computer Science Club there.
